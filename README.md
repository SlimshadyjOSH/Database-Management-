# Movie Sales Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the factors that influence movie sales using SQL and Python. The goal is to identify the key attributes that lead to high sales for a movie. By examining various data points such as production budget, genre, creative type, and other factors, we aim to determine which elements contribute most to a movie's success in terms of sales.

## Setup Instructions

To set up the project, the following tools are required:

- **MSSQL or PostgreSQL** for database management
- **Python** with Anaconda and required libraries (e.g., pandas, psycopg2, pyodbc)
- **Excel** for dataset preparation and analysis
- **Integrated Development Environments** like Anaconda or VSCode for SQL and Python

### Steps:

1. Establish a connection with MSSQL or PostgreSQL database.
2. Set up the Python environment through Anaconda and ensure necessary packages are installed.
3. Prepare datasets in Excel and ensure proper structure before importing into the database.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Define Hypotheses**: Identify factors to be tested, such as genre, budget, or release date.
2. **Dataset Preparation**: Clean and organize the datasets to ensure they are ready for analysis.
3. **Create Database Tables**: Set up appropriate database tables for storing movie-related data.
4. **Define Primary and Foreign Keys**: Ensure that each table has a properly defined primary key and establish relationships between tables using foreign keys.
5. **Establish Relationships Between Tables**: Set up relationships between tables to ensure data integrity and consistency.
6. **Generate ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram)**: Create an ERD schema to visualize the relationships between tables and their respective keys.
7. **Data Import**: Import the cleaned datasets into the database.
8. **SQL Queries**: Write and execute SQL queries to analyze the data and test hypotheses.
9. **Encapsulation with Python**: Use Python to encapsulate database operations and streamline the analysis process.

## Contribution

Contributors are welcome to propose new hypotheses related to movie sales and test them using the existing data structure and methodology. New ideas for data analysis are also encouraged.
